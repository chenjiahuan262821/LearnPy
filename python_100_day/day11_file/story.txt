long long ago 
there is a princess in the forest
she cannot remember where was she from
what she knows is her happiness here
with her good friends
sunshine, flowers, grass, butterflies...
everyday she gives a "good morning" and "good night"
but one day
as if it is destined that 
the prince comes and tell her
leave here, go with me, there is wonderful world outside
a deep silence
she loves him deadly
while she also loves the forest to death
she is on the horns of dilemma...

Dear, it is late and you should close your eyes.
The story is to be continued tomorrow.

Okay, dad. Love you three thousand.

Good night.
